into a Database


Changelog
=============
v 0.5
added plugin system back in
oh and btw 
I HATE ENCODING ERRORS!!!


v 0.4
added new type to config
now you can html and xml

v 0.3 
nearly complete rewrite, cleanup and a change in behaviour
you now only need the correct config file and xpath to collect the 
data. 
Let's see if it works for all stations.


Known Bugs / Todo
=============
- There must be a directory called database or else it fails to run

- Some Stations describe the Artists with Name, Surname so the 
these Artist gets at least two places in the Database.

- do some more Logging

- add a debugging mode 

- fix all errors :)
